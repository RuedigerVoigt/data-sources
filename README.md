# Data Sources

Mainly free data sources useful for political science or machine learning. Most of them I used in some project:

* [Data Portals](data-portals.md)
* [Geographic Data](geo-data.md)
* [Peace and Conflict Studies](peace-and-conflict-studies.md)


## Personal Data Driven Projects

* [exoskeleton](https://github.com/RuedigerVoigt/exoskeleton): a Python framework to build polite, but tenacious crawlers / scrapers with database backend
* [Tracking Covid-19 in Germany](https://github.com/RuedigerVoigt/track-covid-19)
